Union minister of railways Ashwini Vaishnaw conducted a meeting on Saturday, five days after the Bengal train accident, and asked his team to scale up the installation of Kavach, an automatic train protection system that is believed to have helped prevent the train collision.
“The minister reviewed the progress of Kavach on Saturday in which officials presented the progress of Version 4.0 of Kavach,” an official close to the development said.
After development of Kavach 4.0 and its certification, Indian Railways (IR) will scale up installation of Kavach in mission mode, a second official in the know of the development said. He said that more manufacturers are developing the system who are in various stages of development.
“IR will complete installing Kavach on Delhi- Mumbai and Delhi- Howrah route by March next year. Tenders for another 6,000-km route are expected to be floated by December this year,” he added.

On June 17, Sealdah bound Kanchanjungha Express was hit by a Goods train in North Bengal impacting the rear end of the passenger train that killed ten people and injured at least 41. The accident raised concern about the absence of the Kavach system on the route, which would have helped to avoid the collision.
